# Jujutsu — Gojo Satoru and Kinji Hakari

Fabric mod for **Minecraft 26.3** (Java 25, Fabric API). Install the jar plus Fabric API.

## Controls

| Key | Base Gojo | Awakened Gojo |
|---|---|---|
| Left click (empty hand) | Light chain · hold = charged heavy | same |
| Z | Lapse Blue (hold to steer) | **Lapse Blue: MAX** |
| X | Reversal Red (hold to charge) | **Reversal Red: MAX** |
| C | — | **Hollow Purple** (hold) |
| V | Teleport (3 charges) | Teleport |
| G | **Awaken** (meter full) | **Domain Expansion: Infinite Void** |
| R | Guard (hold; tap early = parry) | same |
| Left Alt | Dash | same |
| \` | Combat stance on/off | same |
| *(unbound)* | Combat / Vanilla Minecraft mode | same |

Melee variations: click in the air for air combos, hold jump on the 4th hit for an uppercut, click while sprinting for a
lunge, look down at a knocked-down enemy for a stomp.

**Awakening.** The bar above the hotbar fills as you fight (landing hits, dealing/taking damage, blocking, parrying).
When full, press G: Gojo pulls off his blindfold and awakens. His kit switches to the MAX techniques, Infinity is always
on, and the bar becomes a timer that drains; MAX moves also spend it. At zero he returns to his base kit.

**Infinite Void** builds a real, sealed dome of blocks (walls, ceiling, floor and underground shell) around the fight for
14 seconds. Everything it replaces (including chest contents, block states, waterlogging) is saved to disk first and
restored exactly afterwards. The barrier can't be mined, blown up or pushed. If the server stops or crashes mid-domain,
the world is restored on the next start.

## Characters

Press **K** (or pause menu → *JJK Settings* → *Choose Character...*) to open the character select screen and click a
card. Every registered character gets a card from its own name, title, description, theme and portrait, so adding a
character never touches the screen. Switching only works from a neutral state: not mid-attack or mid-cast, not
awakened or in Jackpot, not in or near a domain or clash, not stunned, and not hit in the last few seconds. The old
kit's techniques, toggles and states are cleared and the new moveset, HUD icons and theme load at once.

| Key | Gojo (Honored One) | Hakari (Restless Gambler) | Hakari in Jackpot |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z | Lapse Blue | Reserve Balls | Lucky Volley |
| X | Reversal Red | Shutter Doors | Lucky Rushdown |
| C | — | Rough Energy | Overwhelming Luck |
| V | Teleport | Fever Breaker | Energy Surge |
| B (Special) | — | Door Guard (hold) | Rhythm |
| G | Awaken → Infinite Void | Idle Death Gamble | — |

### Kinji Hakari — Restless Gambler

Gambling → domain → Jackpot → sustain → pressure.

- **Reserve Balls**: a quick three-ball volley of steel pachinko balls. They bounce once off surfaces, and the last
  one knocks back.
- **Shutter Doors**: two steel shutters rise out of the ground on either side of the target and slam shut. They crush
  the target and pin them in hitstun from range.
- **Rough Energy**: a committed wind-up, then a guard-breaking straight at the very end of it that gouges the ground.
- **Fever Breaker**: a spinning kick knocks them away, Hakari rushes them down, and a second, heavier kick breaks them.
- **Door Guard** (Special, hold): a red lacquer door stops everything from the front. Melee caught in the first few
  ticks makes the door swing open into the attacker.
- **Idle Death Gamble** (full Awakening meter): a physical domain built by the shared framework, with a neon pachinko
  wall, a casino floor, sweeping spotlights and giant slot reels over the arena. The sure-hit only imparts the rules
  and deals no damage.
  - **Visual moves**: Hakari's techniques used inside the domain count as visual moves, and enough of them start a
    **Riichi**.
  - **Riichi**: a scenario is drawn (Transit Card, Seat Struggle or Potty Emergency) with a green, red, gold or
    rainbow signal. A cut-in plays, the first two reels lock and the third spins down.
  - **Attempts**: a miss goes back to spinning for another attempt. A final attempt is forced as the domain runs out.
  - **Bonuses**: odd jackpot numbers give the next domain better odds, and even ones give it a head start. Both are
    kept for one life only.
  - **Missing entirely**: if the domain ends without a jackpot, part of the meter is refunded.
- **Jackpot**: full heal, unlimited cursed energy and heavy regeneration. A lethal blow is survived, but not twice in
  quick succession. The timer is a big casino-lit bar at the top of the screen. The kit becomes:
  - **Lucky Volley**: an opener, a flurry, then a final strike.
  - **Lucky Rushdown**: run the target down, drag them, then throw them.
  - **Overwhelming Luck**: a march of escalating punches ending in a blast.
  - **Energy Surge**: a dash, then he vanishes, reappears above the target and axe-kicks down.
  - **Rhythm**: press the Special key on each beat. Landed beats stretch the Jackpot, and all GREAT or better gives a
    Lucky Streak damage buff.

## HUD and Vanilla Minecraft mode

CE is a slim vertical bar on the left edge. It eases between values, what you just spent lingers as a pale ghost, it
turns red and pulses when low, and it reads EMPTY when nothing is left. The current moveset is shown on the right as
16x16 pixel-art icons with each one's bound key beside it, following your Controls settings. The icons show when a move
is on cooldown (a receding shade and the time left) and when there isn't enough CE or Awakening meter. When Awakening
starts, the icons flip over to the MAX moves and are named for a moment. The Awakening meter stays its own bar above the
hotbar.

**Vanilla Minecraft mode** (pause menu → *JJK Settings* → *Combat Mode: VANILLA*, or bind *Toggle Combat / Vanilla
Minecraft mode* in Controls) hides every JJK HUD element and switches off all of the mod's ability keys, melee and clash
inputs, so you can build and mine without setting anything off. The choice is saved in `config/jjk.json`.

Infinity is implemented but not currently part of Gojo's moveset; `infinity.inMoveset` in the config brings it back.

## Visual tiers

Every technique has its own look, and power reads at a glance:

1. **Basic** — melee: thin swing arcs, sharp impact stars, small ripples.
2. **Base techniques** — Blue (a compact core with light spiralling *in*), Red (a jittering core throwing spikes *out*,
   compress → shockwave), Infinity (faint ripples where attacks stop), Teleport (space folds shut, snaps open).
3. **Awakening** — the reveal pillar and ground waves; Max Blue (event horizon, accretion disk, huge lensing, battlefield
   pull) and Max Red (catastrophic blast, triple shockwave) as inward/outward equals.
4. **Hollow Purple and Infinite Void** — the only effects with impact frames; Purple is awakening-only.

![Base vs Max](docs/screenshots/base_vs_max.png)

Effects fade when the camera is inside them, spawn fewer particles past 48 blocks, and small ones are sound-only past
96 blocks. `particleQuality` (0–3) in the client config scales every particle count.

## Opening a domain

A domain physically builds itself out of blocks, starting at the caster's feet: the ground spreads outward to the
outer ring, the walls rise and curve over into the ceiling, then the underground half seals and a pulse confirms it —
about two seconds, with a bright energy edge tracing the newest blocks. The barrier and sure-hit switch on only once
it is sealed. Everything replaced (including paintings and item frames inside) comes back exactly when it ends.

Every opening is presented: the caster gets a short cinematic (portrait, energy, the structure forming, then
"DOMAIN EXPANSION — INFINITE VOID"); nearby players see it build in their world with a light banner.

**Counter:** when someone nearby starts opening a domain and your Awakening meter is full, your Awakening key becomes
a counter for a moment — instant Awakening, your domain opens at once, a "DOMAIN EXPANSION VS DOMAIN EXPANSION" card
presents both of you, and the domains collide into the clash below. Miss the window and the key is a normal Awakening.

## Domain clashes

When two domains overlap they don't just fight on stats — the owners duel for control in a rhythm minigame. Both get
the same chart of prompts (← ↓ ↑ →, played with the arrow keys or A S W D). Each press is judged on timing
(PERFECT / GREAT / GOOD / MISS, windows configurable) and pushes a shared tug-of-war meter; streaks push harder (capped,
so consistency matters more than a lucky run). Every PERFECT sends an energy pulse out of the player through their
domain; misses make it flicker. Whoever holds the meter at the end — or drives it all the way across — wins; the
loser's domain collapses and gives its blocks back. Dead-even clashes go to sudden death. Domain strength, stats and
who expanded first never decide it.

## Temporary battle damage

Every block a technique destroys comes back exactly — state, container contents, the torch on it, the painting on
the wall, the sand that fell — three minutes after *that block* was damaged. Nothing drops, so nothing duplicates.
Player changes made in the meantime are kept (`restoration.conflictPolicy`). Pending restorations survive restarts.
Domain structures are separate and restore as soon as the domain ends. `/jjk restore status|now|forget`.

## Commands (op)

`/jjk arena` test arena with dummies · `/jjk dummy [stand|jump|fight] [n]` · `/jjk nocooldown true|false` ·
`/jjk awakening <amount>|end` · `/jjk reset` · `/jjk character gojo|none` · `/jjk domain cancel [all]` ·
`/jjk status [target]` · `/jjk config reload`

## Config

`config/jjk.json` holds every tunable (damage, cooldowns, costs, Awakening gain/drain/move costs, domain size/duration,
destruction limits, particle quality, screen effects, sound volume). `/jjk config reload` applies changes.

## Development

- `./gradlew build` — mod jar in `build/libs`
- `./gradlew runGameTest` — server GameTests (combat, techniques, Awakening, domain structure restore/crash recovery)
- `./gradlew runClientGameTest` — drives a real client through the whole kit with real input and takes screenshots
  (headless: run under Xvfb with Mesa; see `src/gametest` for the test-only headless mixin)
- `tools/gen_sounds.py`, `tools/gen_textures.py` regenerate the synthesized sounds and textures
